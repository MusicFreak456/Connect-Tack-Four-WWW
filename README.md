# Connect Tack Four

Plagiarised game made for learning purposes.

## Why?

I wanted to get familiar with laravel and Vue frameworks.

## What are the rules?

Game is much like Tick Tack Toe, except the grid is larger. Players can only
place their symbol on tiles that are on the bottom of the grid or directly above
already used ones. To mix it up, let's say you're a player wich marks tiles with 'X', then you can also click on one of the tiles marked with 'X' that are right on the bottom and it will be moved on top of the column, all of the tiles that were above the clicked one will be moved one row down, and another one marked 'X' will apear on the top (sounds rather complicated, you just have to see it).
